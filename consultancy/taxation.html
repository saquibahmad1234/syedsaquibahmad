    <h1>Taxation</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      I think about taxation less as a compliance exercise and more as a
      decision-making problem. Most tax mistakes don’t come from ignorance —
      they come from acting before understanding consequences.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page brings together how I approach taxation, the kind of questions
      I spend time on, and writing that explores tax-related decisions with
      clarity and restraint.
