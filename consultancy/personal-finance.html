    <h1>Personal Finance</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      I think about personal finance less as optimisation and more as structure.
      Most financial stress doesn’t come from low income or bad investments — it
      comes from unclear systems and rushed decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page brings together how I think about personal finance, the kinds of
      problems I spend time on, and writing that explores money decisions with
      patience and long-term perspective.
