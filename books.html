        <p class="book-description">
          Aahil and Anya meet each other by pure coincidence on a random night. But this isn’t the first time they have met.
They met for the first time as teenagers. Eight years later, their paths have crossed again, and despite not being together for so long, their connection is undeniable.
But when fate brings two people, from two very different worlds together, for the second time, they are determined to make it work this time.
As they navigate the complexities of love, familial expectations and societal pressures, they must decide whether their bond is powerful enough to defy the odds. Can they overcome the obstacles that once tore them apart? Or will history be repeated again?
A poignant tale of love, sacrifice and second chances, Maybe Second Time’s a Charm is a journey of discovering whether love can truly conquer all.
