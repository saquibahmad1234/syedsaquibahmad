The Union Budget 2026 has introduced significant structural changes to India's taxation system, most notably the transition to a completely new **Income Tax Act, 2025**. While the tax slabs themselves remain stable, the rules for investments like Gold and Shares have undergone a major overhaul.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what was before, what has changed now, and the implications for your money.

## 1. Income Tax Slabs & Rates
* **Before (FY 2025-26):** The "New Tax Regime" had tax-free income up to ₹12 Lakh (via rebate) and a Standard Deduction of ₹75,000 for salaried employees.
* **Now (FY 2026-27):** **No Change.** The government has maintained the status quo. The aggressive tax cuts introduced in the previous budget continue.
    * **Insight:** Stability is the focus. If you are a salaried employee earning up to ₹12.75 Lakh, you continue to pay zero tax. The "Old Regime" still exists but is becoming increasingly irrelevant for most taxpayers.

## 2. Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)
* **Before:** Capital gains arising from the redemption of SGBs were **tax-free** for any individual who held the bond until maturity. It did not matter if you bought the bond directly from the RBI or from the secondary market (stock exchange).
* **Now:** The tax exemption on maturity is now available **only to original subscribers** (those who bought directly from RBI/Banks during the issue).
    * **The Change:** If you buy SGBs from the secondary market (stock exchange) and hold them to maturity, your gains will now be **taxable** (likely as LTCG).
    * **Implication:** The "arbitrage" trade is dead. Investors can no longer buy SGBs at a discount on the exchange and expect a tax-free exit. Secondary market yields will likely drop as buyers factor in the tax cost.

## 3. Share Buybacks
* **Before:** When a company bought back its own shares, the **company** paid a "Buyback Tax" (approx 20%). The income received by the shareholder was **tax-free**.
* **Now:** The burden has shifted to the shareholder.
    * **The Change:** Proceeds from a buyback will now be taxed as **Dividend Income** in your hands. This means it will be added to your total income and taxed at your applicable slab rate (which could be 30%).
    * **The Relief:** The cost at which you bought the shares will be treated as a *capital loss*, which you can set off against other capital gains.
    * **Implication:** High-income earners (30% bracket) lose out significantly here. It is now more tax-efficient to sell shares in the open market (paying 12.5% LTCG) rather than tendering them in a buyback (paying 30% slab rate).

## 4. TCS on Foreign Travel & Education
* **Before:** Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on overseas tour packages and LRS remittances was high—often **5%** or **20%** depending on the amount (above ₹7 Lakh).
* **Now:** A flat rate of **2% TCS** applies to overseas tour packages and remittances for education/medical treatment.
    * **Implication:** This is a relief for middle-class travelers. It reduces the upfront cash blockage when booking international holidays or funding education abroad.

## 5. The "Income Tax Act, 2025"
* **Before:** We were governed by the *Income Tax Act, 1961*, which was six decades old and filled with complex amendments.
* **Now:** A new simplified code, titled the **Income Tax Act, 2025**, will come into effect from April 1, 2026.
    * **Insight:** While the rates haven't changed, the *language* of the law is being simplified to reduce litigation. Expect simpler ITR forms and easier compliance next year.

## 6. TDS on Property Purchase from NRIs
* **Before:** Buying a property from an NRI was a compliance nightmare. The buyer had to obtain a **TAN** (Tax Deduction Account Number) to deduct TDS.
* **Now:** The requirement for TAN has been removed.
    * **The Change:** TDS can now be deducted and deposited using the buyer's simple **PAN** and the seller's PAN.
    * **Implication:** This removes a major hurdle for resident Indians buying property from NRIs, making real estate transactions smoother.

### Summary Table

* **Slabs:** No Change (₹12L limit continues).
* **Gold (SGB):** Tax-free only for original buyers. Taxable for secondary buyers.
* **Buybacks:** Taxable as Dividend (Slab Rate) instead of tax-free.
* **Foreign Travel:** TCS reduced to flat 2%.
