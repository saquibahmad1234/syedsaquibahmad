## 1. Share Buybacks: The Big Relief
* **The Recent Past (2024-2025):** In Budget 2024, the government shifted the tax burden to shareholders, treating buyback proceeds as **"Deemed Dividend."** This meant investors paid tax at their slab rate (up to 30%+), making buybacks very unattractive.
* **Now (Budget 2026):** The government has listened to feedback and **reclassified buyback income as Capital Gains.**
    * **The Change:** Instead of paying slab rates (30%), you will now pay **Capital Gains Tax**.
    * **The Rate:**
        * **Long Term (>12 months):** 12.5% (after ₹1.25L exemption).
        * **Short Term (<12 months):** 20%.
    * **Implication:** This is a massive win for investors. It restores the attractiveness of share buybacks as a tax-efficient way to return cash to shareholders.

## 2. Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)
* **Before:** Capital gains on redemption were **tax-free** for any individual who held the bond until maturity, regardless of whether they bought it from the RBI or the secondary market.
* **Now:** The tax exemption on maturity is now available **only to original subscribers** (those who bought directly from RBI during the issue).
    * **The Change:** If you buy SGBs on the stock exchange (secondary market) and hold to maturity, your gains are now **taxable**.
    * **Implication:** The "arbitrage" trade—buying discounted SGBs on the exchange for tax-free gains—is over. Secondary market buyers must now factor in the 12.5% LTCG tax.

## 3. Income Tax Slabs & Rates
* **Before (FY 2025-26):** The "New Tax Regime" offered tax-free income up to ₹12 Lakh (via rebate) and a Standard Deduction of ₹75,000.
* **Now (FY 2026-27):** **No Change.** The government has maintained the status quo.
    * **Insight:** Stability is the focus. If you are a salaried employee earning up to ₹12.75 Lakh, you continue to pay zero tax. The "Old Regime" still exists but is becoming increasingly irrelevant for most taxpayers.

## 4. TCS on Foreign Travel
* **Before:** Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on overseas tour packages was often **5%** or **20%** depending on the amount.
* **Now:** A flat rate of **2% TCS** applies to overseas tour packages.
    * **Implication:** This reduces the upfront cash blockage for middle-class families booking international holidays.

## 5. The "Income Tax Act, 2025"
* **Before:** Governed by the *Income Tax Act, 1961*.
* **Now:** A new simplified code, the **Income Tax Act, 2025**, replaces the 6-decade-old law effective April 1, 2026.
    * **Insight:** The new Act promises simpler language and fewer litigations, aiming to make tax compliance easier for the common man.
