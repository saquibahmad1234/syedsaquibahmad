    <h1>Consultancy</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      I work with people who want clarity around money — not urgency, not hype.
      The focus is on understanding decisions before acting on them, especially
      when the consequences compound over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work usually sits at the intersection of taxation, personal finance,
      and long-term investing. The goal is not optimisation for its own sake,
      but calm, informed decision-making.
