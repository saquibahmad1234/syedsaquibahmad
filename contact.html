    <p class="intro">
      If you’d like to talk — about taxation, personal finance, or a specific
      decision you’re thinking through — the best place to start is a simple
      conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t believe good financial decisions should feel rushed. If this way
      of thinking resonates, feel free to reach out.

      Please note: I don’t offer quick answers or one-off opinions without
      context. Meaningful conversations tend to start with understanding the
      full picture.
