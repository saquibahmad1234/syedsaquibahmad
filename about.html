    <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        I’ve always been interested in understanding money beyond numbers — how it
        shapes choices, anxiety, freedom, and long-term thinking. Over time, this
        curiosity naturally extended into taxation, investing, and personal finance.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t believe financial decisions should feel rushed, opaque, or
        overwhelming. Most mistakes with money don’t happen because people lack
        intelligence — they happen because clarity is missing.

      This website serves two purposes. One, it’s a place where I write — to think
      clearly, document ideas, and share what I’m learning. Two, it’s where I work
      with people who want thoughtful, grounded guidance around taxes,
      investments, and financial planning.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re here to read, I hope something here helps you see money a little
      more clearly. If you’re here to work together, I believe good outcomes start
      with good conversations.
